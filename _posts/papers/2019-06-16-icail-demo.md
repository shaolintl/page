Computer systems are playing a substantial role in
assisting people in a wide range of tasks, including search in large
data and decision-making; and their employment is progressively
becoming vital in an increasing number of fields. One of these fields
is legal reasoning: New court cases and legislations are accumulated
every day. In addition, international organizations like the European
Union are constantly aiming at combining and integrating separate
legal systems. In contrast to this situation, the automation of le-
gal reasoning is still underdeveloped albeit being an growing field of
research. In recent years automatic procedures, e.g. for courtroom
management 1 and legal language processing/management, ex-
pert systems based on cases or rules, and normative compliance
tools 2 have been introduced. Additionally, logical systems for auto-
matic reasoning over sets of norms have been developed, such as
for the HIPAA and GLBA privacy laws, for business and the
GDPR.
