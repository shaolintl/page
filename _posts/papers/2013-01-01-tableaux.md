Computer-generated proofs are usually difficult to grasp for
a human reader. In this paper we present an approach to understanding
resolution proofs through Herbrandâ€™s theorem and the implementation
of a tool based on that approach.
The information we take as primitive is which instances have been chosen
for which quantifiers, in other words: an expansion tree. After computing
an expansion tree from a resolution refutation, the user is presented this
information in a graphical user interface that allows flexible folding and
unfolding of parts of the proof.
This interface provides a convenient way to focus on the relevant parts
of a computer-generated proof. In this paper, we describe the proof-
theoretic transformations, the implementation and demonstrate its use-
fulness on several examples.
