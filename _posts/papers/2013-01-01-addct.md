Unifiability algorithms for higher-order logic are algorithms
which decide the unification problem for sub-classes of higher-order logic
by providing a witness. They contrast with unification procedures by
deciding unification problems of infinitary nature, which might have in-
finitely many most general unifiers. Unification procedures for these sub-
classes return a complete set of these unifiers and do not terminate.
The common practice in automated deduction for higher-order logic is
to utilize unification procedures and to force their termination by re-
stricting the size of the generated unifiers. The unifiability algorithms,
which are complete for certain sub-classes, allow us to have a more se-
mantical approach. In this paper we claim that the standard resolution
calculi for higher-order automated deduction do not take full advantage
of the strengths of these algorithms and suggest a new calculus. We prove
that this calculus can have an exponential speed-up over the traditional
calculi.
