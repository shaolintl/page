In the present work we illustrate how two sorts of defeasible
reasoning that are fundamental in the normative domain, that is,
reasoning about exceptions and reasoning about violations, can be simulated
via monotonic propositional theories based on a bimodal language with
primitive operators representing knowledge and obligation. The proposed
theoretical framework paves the way to using native theorem provers for
multimodal logic, such as MleanCoP, in order to automate normative
reasoning.
