Different theorem provers tend to produce proof objects in different formats and this is especially the
case for modal logics, where several deductive formalisms (and provers based on them) have been
presented. This work falls within the general project of establishing a common specification language
in order to certify proofs given in a wide range of deductive formalisms. In particular, by using a
translation from the modal language into a first-order polarized language and a checker whose small
kernel is based on a classical focused sequent calculus, we are able to certify modal proofs given in
labeled sequent calculi, prefixed tableaux and free-variable prefixed tableaux. We describe the general
method for the logic K, present its implementation in a Prolog-like language, provide some examples
and discuss how to extend the approach to other normal modal logics.
