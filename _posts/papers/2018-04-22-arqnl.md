Most theorem provers and proof assistants are written in imperative or
functional
programming languages. Recently, the claim that higher-order logic
programming languages
might be better suited for this task was revisited and a new
interpreter, as well as new
proof assistants based on it, were introduced. In this paper we follow
these claims and
describe a concise implementation of a prototype for a semi-automated
proof assistant for
first-order modal logics. The aim of this paper is to encourage the
development of personal
proof assistants and semi-automated provers for a variety of modal
logics.
