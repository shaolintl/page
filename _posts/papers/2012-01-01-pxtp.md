This paper describes a new feature of the GAPT framework, namely the ability to im-
port refutations obtained from external automated theorem provers. To cope with coarse-
grained, under-specified and non-standard inference rules used by various theorem provers,
the technique of proof replaying is employed. The refutations provided by external theo-
rem provers are replayed using GAPTâ€™s built-in resolution prover (TAP), which generates
refutations that use only three basic fine-grained inference rules (resolution, factoring and
paramodulation) and are therefore more suitable to be manipulated by the proof-theoretic
algorithms implemented in GAPT.
