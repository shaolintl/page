The second-order unification problem is undecidable. While
unification procedures, like Huet’s pre-unification, terminate with success
on unifiable problems, they might not terminate on non-unifiable ones.
There are several decidability results for infinitary unification, such as for
monadic second-order problems. These results are based on the regular
structure of the solutions of these problems and by computing minimal
unifiers. In this paper we describe a refinement to Huet’s pre-unification
procedure for arbitrary second-order signatures which, in some cases, ter-
minates on problems on which the original pre-unification procedure fails
to terminate. We show that the refinement has, asymptotically, the same
complexity as the original procedure. Another contribution of the paper
is the identification of a new decidable class of second-order unification
problems.
