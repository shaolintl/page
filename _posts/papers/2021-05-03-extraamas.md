A key challenge in making a transparent formalization of a
legal text is the dependency on two domain experts. While a legal expert
is needed in order to interpret the legal text, a logician or a programmer
is needed for encoding it into a program or a formula. Various existing
methods are trying to solve this challenge by improving or automating
the  communication  between  the  two  experts.  In  this  paper,  we  follow
a  different  direction  and  attempt  to  eliminate  the  dependency  on  the
target domain expert. This is achieved by inverting the translation back
into  the  original  text.  By  skipping  over  the  logical  translation,  a  legal
expert can now both interpret and evaluate a translation.
