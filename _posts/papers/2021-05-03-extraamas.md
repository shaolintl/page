A key challenge in making a transparent formalization of alegal text is the dependency on two domain experts. While a legal expertis needed in order to interpret the legal text, a logician or a programmeris needed for encoding it into a program or a formula. Various existingmethods are trying to solve this challenge by improving or automatingthe  communication  between  the  two  experts.  In  this  paper,  we  followa  different  direction  and  attempt  to  eliminate  the  dependency  on  thetarget domain expert. This is achieved by inverting the translation backinto  the  original  text.  By  skipping  over  the  logical  translation,  a  legalexpert can now both interpret and evaluate a translation.
