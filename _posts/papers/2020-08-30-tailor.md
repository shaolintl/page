The GDPR is one of many legal texts which can greatly
benefit from the support of automated reasoning. Since its introduction,
efforts were made to formalize it in order to support various automated
operations. Nevertheless, widespread and efficient automated reasoning
over the GDPR has not yet been achieved. In this paper, a tool called
the NAI suite is being used in order to annotate article 13 of the GDPR.
The annotation results in a fully formalized version of the article, which
deals with the transparency requirements of data collection and processing. Automated compliance checking is then being demonstrated via
several simple queries. By using the public API of the NAI suite, arbitrary tools can use this procedure to support trust management and
GDPR compliance functions.
