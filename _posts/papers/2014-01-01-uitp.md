Sequent calculus is widely used for formalizing proofs. However, due to the proliferation of data, un-
derstanding the proofs of even simple mathematical arguments soon becomes impossible. Graphical
user interfaces help in this matter, but since they normally utilize Gentzen’s original notation, some
of the problems persist. In this paper, we introduce a number of criteria for proof visualization which
we have found out to be crucial for analyzing proofs. We then evaluate recent developments in tree
visualization with regard to these criteria and propose the Sunburst Tree layout as a complement to
the traditional tree structure. This layout constructs inferences as concentric circle arcs around the
root inference, allowing the user to focus on the proof’s structural content. Finally, we describe its
integration into P ROOF T OOL and explain how it interacts with the Gentzen layout.
