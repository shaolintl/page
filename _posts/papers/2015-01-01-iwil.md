The TPTP library is one of the leading problem libraries in the automated theorem
proving community. Along the years, support was added for problems beyond those in first-
order clausal form. Another addition was the augmentation of the language to support
proofs outputted from theorem provers and the maintenance of a proof library, called
TSTP. In this paper we propose another augmentation of the language for the support of
the semantics of the inference rules used in these proofs.
