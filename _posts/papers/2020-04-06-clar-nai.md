title: Towards an Executable Methodology for the Formalization of Legal Texts
year: 2020
venue:  The 3rd International Conference on Logic and Argumentation

A methodology for the formalization of legal texts is presented. This
methodology is based on features of the NAI Suite, a recently developed
formalization environment for legal texts. The ability of the tool to
execute queries is used in order to drive a correct formalization until
all queries are validated. The approach is studied on a fragment of the
Smoking Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Act 2016 of
the Scottish Parliament.
