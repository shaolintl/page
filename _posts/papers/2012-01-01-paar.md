The efficiency of the first-order resolution calculus is impaired when lifting it to higher-order logic.
The main reason for that is the semi-decidability and infinitary nature of higher-order unification
algorithms, which requires the integration of unification within the calculus and results in a non-
efficient search for refutations. We present a modification of the constrained resolution calculus
(Huetâ€™72) which uses an eager unification algorithm while retaining completeness. The algorithm is
complete with regard to bounded unification only, which for many cases, does not pose a problem in
practice.
