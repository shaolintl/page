Cut-elimination is the most prominent form of proof trans-
formation in logic. The elimination of cuts in formal proofs corresponds
to the removal of intermediate statements (lemmas) in mathematical
proofs. The cut-elimination method CERES (cut-elimination by resolu-
tion) works by extracting a set of clauses from a proof with cuts. Any
resolution refutation of this set then serves as a skeleton of an ACNF,
an LK-proof with only atomic cuts.
The system CERES, an implementation of the CERES-method has been
used successfully in analyzing nontrivial mathematical proofs (see [4]).In
this paper we describe the main features of the CERES system with spe-
cial emphasis on the extraction of Herbrand sequents and simplification
methods on these sequents. We demonstrate the Herbrand sequent ex-
traction and simplification by a mathematical example.
