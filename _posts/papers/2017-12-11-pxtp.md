The search for increased trustworthiness of SAT solvers is very active
and uses various methods. Some of these methods obtain a proof from the
provers then check it, normally by replicating the search based on the
proof's information. Because the certification process involves another
nontrivial proof search, the trust we can place in it is decreased. Some
attempts to amend this use certifiers which have been verified by proofs
assistants such as Isabelle/HOL and Coq. Our approach is different
because it is based on an extremely simplified certifier. This certifier
enjoys a very high level of trust but is very inefficient. In this
paper, we experiment with this approach and conclude that by placing
some restrictions on the formats, one can mostly eliminate the need for
search and in principle, can certify proofs of arbitrary size.
