Systems of deontic logic suffer either from being too expressive and
therefore hard to mechanize, or from being too simple to capture
relevant aspects of normative reasoning. In this article we look for a
suitable way in between: the automation of a simple logic of normative
ideality and sub-ideality that is not affected by many deontic paradoxes
and that is expressive enough to capture contrary-to-duty reasoning.
We show that this logic is very useful to reason on normative scenarios
from which one can extract a certain kind of argumentative structure,
called a Normative Detachment Structure with Ideal Conditions. The
theoretical analysis of the logic is accompanied by examples of
automated reasoning on a concrete legal text.
