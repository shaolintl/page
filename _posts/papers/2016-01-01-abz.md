Executions in the PharOS real-time system are determin-
istic in the sense that the sequence of local states for every process is
independent of the order in which processes are scheduled. The essential
ingredient for achieving this property is that a temporal window of ex-
ecution is associated with every instruction. Messages become visible to
receiving processes only after the time window of the sending message
has elapsed. We present a high-level model of PharOS in TLA + and
formally state and prove determinacy using the TLA + Proof System.
