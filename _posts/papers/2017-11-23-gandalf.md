Several proof formalisms have been used, and in some cases even
introduced, in order to define proof systems for modal logic. Our work
falls within a more general project of establishing a common
specification language for checking proofs given in a wide range of
deductive formalisms. In this paper, we consider the case of labeled
proof systems for modal logics, i.e., in particular, Negri's labeled
se-quent calculi, Fitting's prefixed tableaux and free-variable prefixed
tableaux, and provide a framework for certifying proofs given in such
calculi. The method is based on the use of a translation from the modal
language into a first-order polarized language and on a checker whose
trusted kernel is a simple implementation of a classical focused sequent
calculus. The framework allows for a high flexibility in the
representation of proofs to be checked, in the sense that even partial
proofs can be verified by employing a process of proof reconstruction.
We describe the general method for modal logics characterized by
geometric frame conditions, present its implementation in a Prolog-like
language, and provide several examples of proof certification in the
case of well-known normal modal logics, like K, S4 and S5.
