There are many legal texts which can greatly benefit from the support of
automated reasoning. Such support depends on the existence of a logical
formalization of the legal text. Among the methods used for the creation
of these knowledge bases, annotation tools attempt to abstract over the
logical language and support non-logicians in their efforts to formalize
documents. Nevertheless, legal documents use a rich language which is
not easy to annotate. In this paper, an existing annotation tool is
being extended in order to support the formalization of a complex
example - the GDPRâ€™s article 13. The complexity of the article prevents
a direct annotation using logical and deontical operators. This is
overcome by the implementation of several macros. We demonstrate the
automated reasoning over the formalized article and argue that macros
can be used to formalize complex legal texts.
