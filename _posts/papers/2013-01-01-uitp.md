This paper describes an implementation and the features of a proof viewer which fulfills
the role of a graphical user interface to the General Architecture for Proof Theory (GAPT)
framework. It contains methods to render classical and schematic sequent calculus proofs
as well as resolution proofs and other tree-like structures in a flexible way. Additional
emphasis is put on the schema proof input format for the end-user which should be as
user-friendly as possible.
