We present a procedure for the bounded unification of higher-order terms [22]. The
procedure extends G. P. Huetâ€™s pre-unification procedure [11] with rules for the generation
and folding of regular terms. The concise form of the procedure allows the reuse of the pre-
unification correctness proof. Furthermore, the regular terms can be restricted in order to
decide the unifiability problem. Finally, the procedure avoids re-computation of terms in
a non-deterministic search which leads to a better performance in practice when compared
to other bounded unification algorithms.
