A prototype for automated reasoning over legal texts, called NAI, is
presented. As an input, NAI accepts formalized logical representations of
such legal texts that can be created and curated using an integrated annotation
interface. The prototype supports automated reasoning over the given text
representation and multiple quality assurance procedures.
