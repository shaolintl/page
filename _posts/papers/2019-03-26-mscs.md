One of the main issues in proof certification is that different theorem
provers, even when designed for the same logic, tend to use different
proof formalisms and to produce outputs in different formats. The
project ProofCert promotes the usage of a common specification language
and of a small and trusted kernel in order to check proofs coming from
different sources and for different logics. By relying on that idea and
by using a classical focused sequent calculus as a kernel, we propose
here a general framework for checking modal proofs. We present the
implementation of the framework in a prolog-like language and show how
it is possible to specialize it in a simple and modular way in order to
cover different proof formalisms, such as labeled systems, tableaux,
sequent calculi and nested sequent calculi. We illustrate the method for
the logic K by providing several examples and discuss how to further
extend the approach.
