Interfacing with theorem provers is normally done by specifying a
strategy. Such a strategy can be
local, such as using tactics in interactive theorem provers, or global
when using automatic ones.
Focused proof calculi have a clear separation between the phases in the
proof search which can
be done fully automatically and those phases which require decision
making. The inference rules of
these proof calculi can be defined using logical formulas, such as
implications.
Logic programming languages allow for proof search over a database of
such logical formulas
and also support interaction with the user via input/output calls.
In this paper we describe a possible process of writing an interactive
proof assistant over a focused
sequent calculus using the higher-order programming language
lambda-prolog. We show that one can
gain a high level of trust in the correctness of the prover, up to the
correctness of an extremely small
kernel. This process might allow one to obtain a fully functional proof
assistant using a small amount
of code and by using a clear process for arbitrary focused calculi.
