A prototype for automated reasoning over legal documents, called NAI, is
presented. It uses formalized representations of legal documents that
are created using a graphical editor that is also provided as part of
NAI. The prototype supports several automated reasoning procedures over
the given formalizations, including the execution of user queries. The
application of NAI is studied using a fragment of the Scottish Smoking
Prohibition (Children in Motor Vehicles) Act 2016.
